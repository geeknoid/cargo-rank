# cargo-aprz Configuration File
# =============================
#
# This file controls how cargo-aprz behaves. In particular, this is where
# you define expressions to appraise the relative quality of crate dependencies.
#
# Visit https://github.com/geeknoid/cargo-aprz for more information

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Risk Thresholds
#
# These thresholds determine the risk level assigned to a crate based on its
# evaluation score (0-100). Crates scoring below medium_risk_threshold are
# high risk, between medium and low thresholds are medium risk, and at or
# above low_risk_threshold are low risk.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Score threshold below which a crate is considered medium risk
medium_risk_threshold = 30.0

# Score threshold at or above which a crate is considered low risk
low_risk_threshold = 70.0

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cache Configuration
#
# Control how long cached data is retained before being refreshed
# Durations can be specified using human-readable formats like:
# - "1 week", "2 weeks", etc.
# - "7 days", "30 days", etc.
# - "24 hours", "48 hours", etc.
# - Or combinations: "1 week 2 days"
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Duration to keep crates.io cache data before re-downloading
crates_cache_ttl = "1 week"

# Duration to keep hosting (GitHub/GitLab) cache data before re-fetching
hosting_cache_ttl = "1 week"

# Duration to keep cached codebase before re-fetching
codebase_cache_ttl = "1 week"

# Duration to keep cached coverage data before re-fetching
coverage_cache_ttl = "1 week"

# Duration to keep the advisory database cached before re-downloading
advisories_cache_ttl = "1 week"

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Expressions
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Expressions that if ANY evaluate to true, the crate is flagged as high risk
high_risk_if_any = []

# Each eval expression has a point value (default 1). All expressions are
# evaluated and a score is computed as granted_points / total_points * 100.
# The score is compared against the risk thresholds below to determine the
# crate's risk level.
eval = []
